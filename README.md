# While( user == gullible )

Challenge issued by **@Odai**.

Write a program that continues to ask the user to enter any number except x (take 5 for example). If the input number is x, warn the user and terminate the program or loop until the user enters any non-x numbers y times. Once the user enters any non-x numbers y times, a "round" is completed.

Bonus: Add a scoring system where the user receives 1 point every time the user completes a round and count how many times the user entered a valid non-x number. Terminate when the user enters "exit".
